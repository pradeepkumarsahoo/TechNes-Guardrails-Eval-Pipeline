# 🛒 TechNest — RAG Evaluation Pipeline

> **One sentence:** Build a small RAG system over a product catalog, then measure exactly how well it performs using RAGAS across 5 metrics — and deploy it confidently on Streamlit Cloud.

> 🚀 **Live demo:** [ragasz.streamlit.app](https://ragasz.streamlit.app/)

## What Are Evals and Why Do They Matter?

When you build a RAG system, you can look at a few answers and say *"looks good."* But that is not good enough. What if it quietly invents facts? What if the retriever fetches the wrong documents? What if the answer completely ignores the question?

**Evals (evaluations)** are automated tests that give you a number for each of those failure modes — before your users discover the problems.

```
Without evals → "It seems fine."
With evals    → "Faithfulness: 0.87  |  Context Recall: 0.91  |  Answer Correctness: 0.81"
```

You go from guessing to measuring.

    style B fill:#d4edda,color:#000
```

| Part | File | What it does |
|------|------|-------------|
| **1. Learning notebook** | `evals.ipynb` | Teaches each RAGAS metric in isolation using hand-crafted examples |
| **2. Live demo** | `app.py` | Runs a real RAG pipeline on a product catalog, then evaluates it end-to-end |

## Part 1 — The Notebook (`evals.ipynb`)

The notebook runs **6 experiments**, each isolating one specific thing that can go wrong in a RAG pipeline.

## Part 2 — The Live Demo (`app.py`)

A Streamlit app that runs a **real** RAG pipeline over a TechNest product catalog and then evaluates it with RAGAS.

### The RAG Pipeline

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    Q([Customer Question]) --> R[Retriever\nCosine similarity\nGemini embeddings]
    R --> |Top 3 chunks| G[Generator\nGroq llama-3.3-70b]
    G --> A([Answer])
    DB[(catalog.json\n15 entries)] --> R
    GEM[Gemini API\ngemini-embedding-2] --> R
```

**How retrieval works:**

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    subgraph Startup["Index time — once"]
        C[catalog.json\n15 entries] --> GE1[Gemini embed_documents]
        GE1 --> M[15x768 numpy matrix\ncached in Retriever]
    end
    subgraph Query["Query time — per golden"]
        Q2[user question] --> GE2[Gemini embed_query]
        GE2 --> CS[Cosine similarity\nvs cached matrix]
        CS --> TOP[Top-3 content chunks]
    end
    M --> CS
```

### The Evaluation Pipeline

    M5 --> CP2

    CP2 --> R[(results.json)]
    R --> D[📊 Streamlit Dashboard]
```

### Rate Limit Strategy

RAGAS calls the Groq judge LLM many times. With a **6,000 TPM** free-tier limit on `llama-3.1-8b-instant`, we need to pace the calls carefully.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant App
    participant Groq as Groq API (6,000 TPM)

    App->>Groq: Score sample 1 (~1,100 tokens)
    Groq-->>App: Score returned ✅
    Note over App: wait 25s (window recovers ~458 tokens)
    App->>Groq: Score sample 2 (~1,100 tokens)
    Groq-->>App: Score returned ✅
    Note over App: ...repeat for all 5 samples...
    Note over App: wait 35s (fully resets window)
    App->>Groq: Next experiment — sample 1
```

| Setting | Value | Why |
|---------|-------|-----|
| Samples at a time | 1 | Prevents burst exceeding 6,000 TPM |
| Sample cooldown | 25s | Partially resets the 60s TPM window |
| Experiment cooldown | 35s | Fully resets before next metric starts |
| Context truncation | 400 chars / 2 chunks | Keeps tokens per call predictable |
| 429 retry wait | 65s | Gives Groq's window time to fully clear |

**Expected runtime for 5 goldens: ~12–15 minutes** for Phase 2.

## Making It Bulletproof on Streamlit Cloud

When we first deployed this on Streamlit Cloud, the pipeline ran but the Results tab showed nothing. Here is exactly what went wrong and the 5 fixes we applied.

### What Went Wrong

**Problem 1 — Silent failures:** When the Groq API returned a rate limit error or a timeout, the scoring function quietly returned `None` instead of showing what happened. The pipeline appeared to finish, but every score was blank.

**Problem 2 — Connection timeout:** Phase 2 takes 12–15 minutes. Streamlit Cloud drops the browser connection after long-running requests. When the connection resumed, the results were gone because they had never been saved to disk.

**Problem 3 — Wrong async method:** We were using `asyncio.get_event_loop().run_until_complete()` to run async code from Streamlit's sync context. On Streamlit Cloud (Linux), Streamlit owns the event loop in that thread — calling `get_event_loop()` returned an event loop that was already running or in a broken state, causing silent failures.

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    A[Pipeline runs for 15 min] --> B{Connection drops?}
    B -- Yes --> C[Results lost ❌\nSession state gone]
    B -- No --> D{Scores were all None?}
    D -- Yes --> E[Results tab shows blank ❌\nSilent API errors]
    D -- No --> F[Results shown ✅]
    style C fill:#d9534f,color:#fff
    style E fill:#d9534f,color:#fff
    style F fill:#5cb85c,color:#fff
```

### The 5 Fixes

#### Fix 1 — Run async code in a worker thread, never touch Streamlit's event loop

```python
# ❌ BEFORE — nest_asyncio.apply() patches asyncio globally
# Breaks Streamlit's anyio loop on Python 3.12+ → NoEventLoopError
import nest_asyncio
nest_asyncio.apply()

# ✅ AFTER — isolated worker thread owns its own fresh event loop
def _run(coro):
    with concurrent.futures.ThreadPoolExecutor(max_workers=1) as executor:
        future = executor.submit(asyncio.run, coro)
        return future.result(timeout=1800)
```

The worker thread creates its own `asyncio.run()` event loop. Streamlit's internal `anyio` loop is never touched. The main thread simply blocks on `future.result()` until the work is done.

**Rule:** nothing inside the worker thread (inside `_run()`) can call `st.*`. All UI updates — `st.success()`, `st.progress()` — happen in the main thread after `_run()` returns.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Main as Main Thread (Streamlit)
    participant Worker as Worker Thread

    Main->>Worker: executor.submit(asyncio.run, coro)
    Note over Main: blocks on future.result()
    Worker->>Worker: asyncio.run(coro) — NO st.* calls
    Worker-->>Main: return result
    Main->>Main: st.success() / st.progress() ✅
```

---

#### Fix 2 — Save a checkpoint after every experiment

Instead of only saving results when everything is done, we write `checkpoint.json` to disk after each experiment completes.

```
Phase 1 done     → checkpoint.json saved  (has enriched RAG responses)
Faithfulness done → checkpoint.json updated (has 1/5 scores)
Answer Relevancy  → checkpoint.json updated (has 2/5 scores)
...
All done          → checkpoint.json + results.json both saved
```

If the browser disconnects after experiment 3, experiments 1–3 are safe on disk. You don't have to restart from scratch.

---

#### Fix 3 — One-click restore from the sidebar

When the app loads, it checks for `checkpoint.json`. If a previous partial run is found, a **Restore from checkpoint** button appears in the sidebar. Clicking it loads everything back into session state and Phase 2 resumes from where it left off — skipping already-completed experiments automatically.

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    A[App starts] --> B{checkpoint.json\nexists?}
    B -- Yes --> C[Show Restore button\nin sidebar]
    B -- No --> D[Fresh start]
    C --> E[User clicks Restore]
    E --> F[Session state repopulated\nPhase 2 resumes from\nlast completed experiment]
    style F fill:#5cb85c,color:#fff
```

---

#### Fix 4 — Surface errors in the UI instead of hiding them

Every scoring call now uses an `error_collector` (a plain Python list). When a sample fails (rate limit, timeout, or any other API error), the error is appended to the list inside the worker thread, then displayed as a visible warning in the main thread — not silently swallowed.

```
Before: sample 3 fails silently → score = None → Results tab shows ⬜ N/A → no idea why
After:  sample 3 fails → ⚠️  "Sample 3: 429 rate limit hit — waiting 65s then retrying…"
                       → retries once automatically
                       → if retry also fails → ⚠️  "Retry also failed: …" shown in UI
```

---

#### Fix 5 — Show partial results while Phase 2 is still running

The Results tab no longer waits for all 5 experiments to finish. It shows whatever scores are available, updating live as each experiment completes. If 3 out of 5 are done, you see 3 columns filled and 2 as N/A — not a blank page.

### Summary of Changes

| File | What changed |
|------|-------------|
| `app.py` | `_run()` uses `ThreadPoolExecutor` — checkpoint save after every experiment — sidebar restore button — skip completed experiments on resume — partial results shown live — errors displayed as warnings |
| `evals/metrics.py` | `_score_one()` accepts `error_collector` list — errors appended and surfaced instead of silently returning `None` — retry logic visible in UI |

```

---

## Setup

### 1. Install dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 2. Add API keys to `.env`

```
GROQ_API_KEY=<your main Groq key>
JUDGE_GROQ=<second Groq key — used only for RAGAS judge calls>
GEMINI_API_KEY=<your Google AI Studio key>
```

> **Why three keys?**
> - `GROQ_API_KEY` — RAG generator (`llama-3.3-70b-versatile`)
> - `JUDGE_GROQ` — RAGAS judge LLM (`llama-3.1-8b-instant`). Keeping it separate means eval can never exhaust your main key. Falls back to `GROQ_API_KEY` if blank.
> - `GEMINI_API_KEY` — Gemini retrieval embeddings (`gemini-embedding-2-preview`). Free key at [aistudio.google.com](https://aistudio.google.com).

On Streamlit Cloud, enter these keys in the **BYOK sidebar** — they are stored in the browser session only, never on disk.

### 3. Run the notebook (Part 1)

Open `evals.ipynb` in Jupyter or VS Code and run all cells top to bottom.

### 4. Run the Streamlit demo (Part 2)

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

Then follow the 4 tabs:

| Tab | What to do |
|-----|-----------|
| 📚 Catalog | Browse the 15-entry knowledge base |
| 🎯 Goldens | Review the 5 Q&A pairs with ground truth |
| 🚀 Run Evaluation | Click **Run Phase 1**, then **Run Phase 2** |
| 📊 Results | View metric scores + download `results.json` |

> **If the connection drops mid-run:** use the **Restore from checkpoint** button in the sidebar. Phase 2 will resume from the last completed experiment automatically.

---
